# Gutten Tree Data 🌲

![Norway Spruce and Larch Forest in Austrian Alps, https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/research-topic/forestry/qr-tree-project/norway-spruce](fotolia-small.jpg)

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenberg’s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

# Import The Data 🌲

```{r}

library(haven)

gutten <- read_dta("gutten.dta")

gutten 

```
# Variables 🌲

`site` Growth *quality* class of the tree’s habitat. 5 levels.

`location` Distinguishes tree *location*. 7 levels.

`tree` An identifier for the tree within location.

`age.base` The tree age taken at ground level.

`height` Tree height, m.

`dbh.cm` Tree diameter, cm.

`volume` Tree volume.

`age.bh` Tree age taken at 1.3 m.

`tree.ID` A factor uniquely identifying the tree.

# A Basic Multilevel Model 🌲

$$\text{height}_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta \text{age_base} + \beta \text{site} + u_{0\text{ tree.ID}} + e_{it}$$

# Frequentist Model in `lmer` 🌲

```{r}

library(lme4)

fit1 <- lmer(height ~ age_base + site + (1 | tree_ID), 
             data = gutten)

summary(fit1)

```

# Bayesian Model With `brms` 🌲

> The models below take a non-trivial amount of time to run.

```{r}

library(brms)

fit2 <- brm(height ~ age_base + site + (1 | tree_ID), 
            data = gutten,
            family = gaussian(), 
            warmup = 2000, 
            iter = 5000)

summary(fit2)

```

# Set Informative Priors 🌲

```{r}

prior1 <- c(
  prior(normal(0, 10), class = Intercept), 
  prior(normal(0, 10), class = b, coef = site) #,
  # prior(cauchy(0, 10), class = sigma)
)

```

# Run The Model With More Informative Prior 🌲

```{r}

fit3 <- brm(height ~ age_base + site + (1 | tree_ID), 
            data = gutten,
            family = gaussian(), 
            prior = prior1,
            warmup = 2000, 
            iter = 5000)

summary(fit3)

```
