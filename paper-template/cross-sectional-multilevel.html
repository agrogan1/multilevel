<p>Why is this an important problem? Are a large number of people affected by A? Are a large number of people affected by B? Are a large number of people affected by C? Are these effects particularly severe? Are populations affected by A, C or B particularly underserved? Is there evidence to suggest a relationship between these factors, or is this relationship under-examined?</p>
<p>What do we know about the nature of this question already?. Here, please review 3-5 articles that discuss the importance of one factor by itself, or some relationship of the factors.</p>

<li>How representative is the sample of other populations, the population of interest, or the population at large?</li>

<li>What constructs are you measuring? What are your measures designed to measure? Where are they from; who created them?</li>
<li>Any information that you can find—and that you think is appropriate—on the reliability and validity of your measures. (If you are using secondary data, you will need to paraphrase the information from an existing publication or report.)</li>
<li>Reliability: Is there any information on test-retest, inter-rater, inter-item reliability? How is this information relevant to your study?</li>
<li>Validity
<ul>
<li>Face validity: In looking at the items, what can you conclude about its content (or face) validity? In other words, in your judgment, do the items seem to reflect the purpose of the measure?</li>
<li>Predictive or concurrent validity: Is any information on these types of validity available?</li>
<li>How is information on validity relevant to your study?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cronbach’s alpha for any scales that you construct.</li>
<li>Response format used, e.g.&nbsp;“true/false”, “Likert scale of 7 points from strongly agree to strongly disagree”</li>

<p>It’s also worth trying out the <code>lean1</code> and <code>lean2</code> schemes (type <code>findit lean2</code> to install).</p>
<p>And the daring are welcome to try my “Michigan” graph scheme, available <a href="https://agrogan1.github.io/Stata/michigan-graph-scheme/">here</a>, <em>caveat emptor</em>.</p>

<section id="discussion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Briefly recapitulate or summarize briefly the results in written form. Do your results support the hypothesis or inform the research question or the discussion in the literature? How so or why? Do your results say anything about causal connections between your two measures? Are your results congruent with any theory about causal connections between your two measures? Can you demonstrate associations that are not necessarily causal? What are the implications for practice, interventions, policy or further research? Do your findings suggest anything about particular policies or programs that should be implemented, funded or continued? Are there gaps in the research that suggest further research is needed? What are the limitations of the methods used? i.e especially given that you are not examining all of the predictors that are theoretically relevant, are there are other variables that should be considered in future, more complicated research?<br>
