# Notation

In these notes I use

* $x$ to denote an independent variable
* $\bar{x}_{..}$ to denote the grand mean
* $\bar{x}_{.j}$ to denote a group mean

Then

* $x - \bar{x..}$ is a grand mean centered variable.
* $x - \bar{x}_{.j}$ is a group mean centered variable.

> All of the approaches listed below seem plausible to me. I think that they are simply different regression sentences, or substantive questions, that one could pose of the data.

# Uncentered x

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta x + e_{ij} + u_{0i}$$

# Grand Mean Centered x

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta (x - \bar{x..}) + e_{ij} + u_{0i}$$

# Group Mean Centered x and Group Mean of x

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta (x - \bar{x}_{.j}) + \beta \bar{x}_{.j} + e_{ij} + u_{0i}$$

# x and Group Mean of x

$$y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta x + \beta \bar{x}_{.j} + e_{ij} + u_{0i}$$
