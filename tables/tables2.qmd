# Introduction ðŸŒ²

This is a shorter working example to make tables in Stata.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

library(Statamarkdown)

```

# Data Source ðŸŒ²

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenbergâ€™s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

![Old Tjikko, a 9,550 Year Old Norway Spruce in Sweden](Old-Tjikko-Small.jpg)

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

# SetupðŸŒ²

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

clear all // clear workspace

use "gutten.dta", clear // use tree data as example

```

# Variables ðŸŒ²

`site` Growth *quality* class of the treeâ€™s habitat. 5 levels.

`location` Distinguishes tree *location*. 7 levels.

`tree` An identifier for the tree within location.

`age_base` The tree age taken at ground level.

`height` Tree height, m.

`dbh_cm` Tree diameter, cm.

`volume` Tree volume.

`age_bh` Tree age taken at 1.3 m.

`tree_ID` A factor uniquely identifying the tree.


# Estimate Multilevel ModelsðŸŒ²

::: {.callout-tip}
## Use `quietly` To Suppress Output

For the sake of parsimony, I use `quietly:` to suppress the output of the `mixed` commands.
:::

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

quietly: mixed height age_base i.site || tree_ID: // shorter mixed model

est store M1 // store the estimates

quietly: mixed height age_base i.site i.location || tree_ID: // longer mixed model

est store M2 // store the estimates 

```

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Table With `etable`ðŸŒ²

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

etable, estimates(M1 M2) /// use these estimate(s)
novarlabel /// variable names only
cstat(_r_b) /// beta's only
showstars showstarsnote /// show stars and note
column(estimate) // column is modelname


```
