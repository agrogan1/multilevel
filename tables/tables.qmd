# Introduction

Stata has a number of ways of making tables. There are some *tweaks* that may be especially useful for multilevel models.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

library(Statamarkdown)

```

# Data Source ðŸŒ²

The data used in this example are derived from the R package *Functions and Datasets for "Forest Analytics with R"*.

According to the documentation, the source of these data are: "von Guttenbergâ€™s Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst) tree measurement data."

The documentation goes on to further note that:

> "The data are measures from 107 trees. The trees were selected as being of average size from healthy and well stocked stands in the Alps."

# Setup

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

clear all // clear workspace

use "gutten.dta", clear // use tree data as example

describe // describe the data

```

# Estimate a Multilevel Model

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

mixed height age_base i.site || tree_ID: // mixed model

est store M1 // store the estimates (this would work with multiple stored estimates)

```

# Use Estimates Table

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

estimates table M1, b(%9.3f) star // nicely formatted table of results

```

# Use Estimates Table With `, variance post`

> Frustratingly, with multilevel models, the default behavior of estimates table is to report the $ln$ of the random effects. I use the `, variance post` option to post the *variance* rather than the *logarithm of the variance*.

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

mixed height age_base i.site || tree_ID: // mixed model

estat sd, variance post // post results as variance scale rather than log scale

est store M2 // store the estimates (this would work with multiple stored estimates)

estimates table M1 M2, b(%9.3f) star // nicely formatted table of results

```

# Use `etable`

```{stata, collectcode=TRUE}

mixed height age_base i.site || tree_ID: // mixed model

```
