   abstract = {Much social and behavioral research involves hierarchical data structures. . . . Recent developments in the statistical theory of hierarchical linear models now afford an integrated set of methods for such applications.  This introductory text explicates the theory and use of hierarchical linear models (HLM) through rich, illustrative examples and lucid explanations. The presentation remains reasonably nontechnical by focusing on three general research purposesâ€”improved estimation of effects within an individual unit, estimating and testing hypotheses about cross-level effects, and partitioning of variance and covariance components among levels. This innovative volume describes use of both two and three level models in organizational research, studies of individual development and meta-analysis applications, and concludes with a formal derivation of the statistical methods used in the book.
