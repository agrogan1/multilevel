# Acknowledgement

This presentation of these ideas draws heavily upon the Stata documentation, although I have changed the notation slightly, and drawn out a few steps.

# Derivation

## A Regression Model With Random Effects

We start with our regression equation.

$$y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{it} + u_{0i} + e_{it}$$

## Intermediate Steps {.panel-name}

### Intermediate Step 1

We can sum both sides over the $t$ time points.

$$\sum_{t} y_{it} = \sum_{t} \beta_0 + \sum_{t} \beta_1 x_{it} + \sum_{t} u_{0i} + \sum_{t} e_{it}$$

### Intermediate Step 2

We can then divide by the number of time points ($T_i$).

$$\sum_{t} y_{it} / T_i = \sum_{t} \beta_0 / T_i + \sum_{t} \beta_1 x_{it} / T_i + \sum_{t} u_{0i} / T_i + \sum_{t} e_{it} / T_i$$

## The Between Estimator

$$\bar y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \bar x_i + u_{0i} + \bar e_i$$

This is sometimes called the between estimator.

## The Fixed Effects Estimator

We can subtract this most recent equation from the first equation.

$$y_{it} - \bar y_i = \beta_1 (x_{it} - \bar x_i) + (e_{it} - \bar e_i)$$

This is the fixed effects (or *within*) estimator.
