abstract = {Researchers are said to commit the ‘ecological fallacy’ when they make untested inferences about individual-level relationships from aggregate data. That practice is called a fallacy because it is based on the problematic assumption that relationships that hold at one level of aggregation also hold at another level of aggregation. Because individual-level data often are unavailable, researchers are subject to the ecological fallacy in virtually all the social and behavioral sciences, from history to political science to epidemiology. An expanding technical literature continues to seek solutions to the problem.}
