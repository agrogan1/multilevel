# Spaghetti Plots

`spagplot`, from IDRE UCLA, is a command that is often used to generate *spaghetti plots*. However, `spagplot` is an older Stata command for which continued support is unclear, and `spagplot` may not work well with even moderately large data sets. The two files in this directory contain a Stata `do` file to generate *spaghetti plots* using only base Stata commands.
